# Challenge \#1 - Address Book

Use XHR to create a simple tabbed contact info collection.

## Requirements

+ The page displays a tab for each letter of the alphabet that is represented in the address book by last name or business name ( `"S"` would contain _Jane Smith_ and _The Smiling Elephant restaurant_ ) 
+ The app comes pre-loaded with info for places in Nashville, like restaurants, sights and other business that have paid you to list them in your app. The built-in addresses/info should be stored in a local JSON file.
+ The user can click a tab to see the listings under that letter, or they can type in a name, and the app displays the matching results. 
+ The user should also be able to store new contacts. The form inputs and submit btn(s) should change from `find contact` to `add contact` based on a radio button selection. 
+ When the user submits a contact, it should display below the form with two buttons: “Save” and “Edit”. If user clicks “save”, the contact should be saved to localStorage, and be available to the same search function that retrieves the built-in contacts.
+ If user clicks “Edit”, the form is re-populated with the contact info so the user can edit it.
+ The UI should use Bootstrap
